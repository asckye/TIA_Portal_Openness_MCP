# Project-mode input contract (V21)

This is the public contract for `simaticml-decode --project ROOT` --
project-scale ingestion of a whole exported SimaticML project tree, as
opposed to the legacy single-block/directory mode described in the main
[README](../README.md). It documents what project mode accepts, how it
classifies and bounds input, what it emits, and what it explicitly does
**not** promise. Nothing here changes or supersedes the main README's
"Fixture provenance and compatibility" or "Untrusted-input policy" sections;
project mode reuses the same untrusted-input walk and the same fixture
corpus, with the same provenance caveats.

For the implementation flow, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md). For the distinction between
implemented behavior and qualified format support, see [CAPABILITIES.md](CAPABILITIES.md).

## Compatibility profile: V21 only

Project mode translates **TIA Portal V21** SimaticML exports only. Every
discovered `.xml` artifact is adapted independently:

- A recognized `SW.Blocks.*` export (FC/FB/DB/OB) or `SW.Types.PlcStruct`
  (UDT) export whose `Engineering` version string contains `V21` is
  translated normally (`ArtifactStatus.COMPLETE`, or `PARTIAL`/`PRESERVED`
  per the usual per-file decode outcome).
- The **same** recognized export with an engineering version that does
  **not** contain `V21` is preserved, not translated: it is recorded with
  `ArtifactStatus.PRESERVED` and a `DiagnosticCode.UNSUPPORTED_TIA_VERSION`
  diagnostic (severity `warning`) naming the version found.
- A recognized export with **no** engineering version at all -- so V21
  cannot even be confirmed -- is likewise preserved, with
  `DiagnosticCode.UNKNOWN_TIA_VERSION` instead.

In both non-V21 cases the artifact is still discovered, identified, and
carries a diagnostic -- it is never silently dropped, and it is never
force-translated on the assumption that non-V21 exports share V21's schema.

Artifacts that are not a `SW.Blocks.*`/`SW.Types.PlcStruct` export at all
(for example a `SW.Tags.PlcTagTable` tag-table export) are preserved with
`DiagnosticCode.UNSUPPORTED_ARTIFACT` regardless of version, following the
same "preserve with diagnostic, never drop" rule.

## Canonical relative-path meaning

Every `SourceLocation.relative_path` is a `PurePosixPath`: forward-slash
separated, POSIX-normalized, and **root-relative** -- relative to the
`ROOT` directory passed to `--project`, never to the current working
directory, the output directory, or any absolute filesystem path. This
holds uniformly on Windows and POSIX hosts: a Windows path such as
`PLC_1\Program blocks\Main.xml` is normalized to
`PLC_1/Program blocks/Main.xml` before it ever reaches a `SourceLocation`.
The manifest never contains an absolute path, a drive letter, or a raw
`os.sep`-joined string.

## `--library-root` selection semantics

By default, an artifact's `ArtifactOrigin` follows a path convention:
anything under a `Types/` subtree is `PROJECT_LIBRARY`, anything under a
`PLC_1/` (or other station) subtree is `USER`, and anything matching
neither is `UNKNOWN`.

`--library-root RELATIVE_PATH` (repeatable) overrides that convention:
every artifact whose `relative_path` falls under one of the given roots is
reclassified as `ArtifactOrigin.PROJECT_LIBRARY`, regardless of what the
path-convention default would have produced. Explicit CLI intent always
wins over the convention.

Each `--library-root` value must be a **normalized relative path under the
project root**:

- An absolute path (e.g. `/etc/passwd`, `C:\...`) is rejected.
- A path containing a `..` segment (e.g. `../escape`) is rejected.

A rejected value never raises, never aborts the run, and never silently
disappears: it produces a `DiagnosticCode.OUTSIDE_ROOT` diagnostic (severity
`error`) and is simply excluded from the set of roots applied -- every other
artifact is still classified normally. When no `--library-root` is given
at all, origin classification is exactly the Task 3 path-convention
default; this is a strict no-op for the common case.

## Symlink and traversal policy

Project-mode discovery reuses the same handle-anchored, TOCTOU-resistant
walk documented in the README's "Untrusted-input policy" section:

- Every export is treated as untrusted.
- Directory scans are handle-anchored per platform: on Windows the root is
  opened once via native NT handles and every child is enumerated/opened
  relative to its parent's own handle, never by re-resolving a path string;
  on POSIX, file descriptors and `O_NOFOLLOW` ensure traversal never
  follows a symlink.
- Every reparse point (junction, symlink, mount point) encountered during
  enumeration is rejected, and symlinked *directories* are never followed
  regardless of depth. `ProjectLimits.follow_symlinks` defaults to `False`;
  project mode's discovery has no supported way to opt back into following
  symlinks.
- A direct or discovered symlink is rejected with
  `DiagnosticCode.SYMLINK_SKIPPED`.
- Platforms without descriptor-relative filesystem support
  (`os.supports_dir_fd/os.supports_follow_symlinks` unavailable) reject
  directory input outright rather than silently falling back to
  path-based traversal.
- A directory that changes while being scanned aborts before any
  discovered file already found is decoded, rather than producing a
  partial-but-unflagged result.

## Default budgets (`ProjectLimits`)

Every numeric budget below is enforced during discovery/adaptation/
resolution and defaults to the value `project_model.ProjectLimits` ships
with; each is independently overridable on the CLI (`--max-files`,
`--max-file-bytes`, `--max-total-bytes`, `--max-depth`,
`--max-xml-elements`, `--max-xml-depth`, `--max-reference-edges`):

| Limit | Default | Exceeding it produces |
|---|---|---|
| `max_files` | `10_000` | `DiagnosticCode.FILE_COUNT_LIMIT` |
| `max_file_bytes` | `16 * 1024 * 1024` (16 MiB) | `DiagnosticCode.FILE_SIZE_LIMIT` |
| `max_total_bytes` | `512 * 1024 * 1024` (512 MiB) | `DiagnosticCode.TOTAL_SIZE_LIMIT` |
| `max_relative_depth` | `32` | `DiagnosticCode.DEPTH_LIMIT` |
| `max_xml_elements` | `500_000` | `DiagnosticCode.XML_ELEMENT_LIMIT` |
| `max_xml_depth` | `128` | `DiagnosticCode.XML_ELEMENT_LIMIT` (`xml_too_complex`) |
| `max_reference_edges` | `100_000` | `DiagnosticCode.REFERENCE_EDGE_LIMIT` |

(`ProjectLimits` also carries a non-numeric `follow_symlinks: bool = False`
flag, covered above.) Inputs that exceed a limit are rejected -- never
truncated -- and the corresponding diagnostic is attached at the point the
limit was reached.

### Known limitation: POSIX open-file-descriptor usage during discovery

On POSIX platforms, project discovery's handle-anchored walk (see
"Symlink and traversal policy" above) opens one file descriptor per
matched artifact and keeps it open until the later parse loop reads and
closes it, so the peak number of simultaneously open file descriptors
during a run is approximately the number of matched files. The default
`max_files` budget above (`10_000`) can exceed a typical POSIX `ulimit -n`
(often around `1024`) on a large real-world project, before `max_files`
itself is ever reached -- raising `EMFILE` mid-discovery, which today
surfaces as a diagnostic shaped like an `OUTSIDE_ROOT`-style rejection
rather than a dedicated resource-exhaustion diagnostic, and aborts
discovery.

This is a known, disclosed scale limitation, not a defect in the
serial/deterministic ingestion design: Windows discovery uses native NT
handles with very high limits and is unaffected, and the committed CI
fixture corpus (24 files) never approaches this threshold. It is deferred
alongside the other scale milestones this plan's Global Constraints
already defer -- "Initial project ingestion is serial and deterministic.
Concurrency, cancellation, streaming, and resume/checkpoints are deferred
scale milestones, not hidden behavior in this release." Raising the
process's open-file-descriptor limit (`ulimit -n`) before running
`--project` against a very large tree, or lowering `--max-files`, are the
current workarounds; no discovery/read code changes for this limitation
in this release.

## Status vocabulary

Every `ArtifactRecord.status` is exactly one of four values:

- `complete` -- fully translated with no loss.
- `partial` -- translated, but some content within the artifact could not
  be rendered/resolved.
- `preserved` -- discovered and identified, but not translated at all (a
  non-V21/unknown-version export, a recognized-but-unsupported artifact
  kind, or similar).
- `failed` -- discovery/adaptation could not produce a usable record at
  all (e.g. malformed XML).

**Any status other than `complete` always carries at least one
`ProjectDiagnostic`** explaining why. `complete` may have zero diagnostics
attached to the artifact itself, but the project's overall
`ProjectIndex.diagnostics` can still be non-empty independently (e.g.
unresolved references originating from a different artifact).

## Diagnostic codes

`DiagnosticCode` is a closed, 16-value enum. There is no catch-all/"other"
code -- every diagnostic project mode emits carries one of these exact
values:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `outside_root` | An `--library-root` value was absolute or escaped the project root via `..` and was ignored. |
| `symlink_skipped` | A symlink or other reparse point was rejected during discovery. |
| `file_count_limit` | `max_files` was reached; remaining files were not discovered. |
| `file_size_limit` | A single file exceeded `max_file_bytes` and was rejected. |
| `total_size_limit` | The combined size of discovered files exceeded `max_total_bytes`. |
| `depth_limit` | A path exceeded `max_relative_depth` directory levels under `ROOT`. |
| `xml_element_limit` | An artifact's XML exceeded `max_xml_elements` elements. |
| `xml_depth_limit` | An artifact's XML exceeded `max_xml_depth` nesting levels. |
| `reference_edge_limit` | `max_reference_edges` was reached; remaining references were not resolved. |
| `malformed_xml` | An artifact's XML failed to parse. |
| `unsupported_artifact` | The XML parsed but its root element(s) are not a recognized SimaticML block or UDT export. |
| `unsupported_tia_version` | A recognized export's engineering version does not contain `V21`. |
| `unknown_tia_version` | A recognized export has no engineering version at all. |
| `duplicate_identity` | Two or more artifacts share the same `QualifiedIdentity` key; none of them is used as a reference-resolution candidate. |
| `unresolved_reference` | A block-call or UDT-member reference names no matching artifact. |
| `ambiguous_reference` | A reference matches two or more candidate artifacts; resolution never guesses via a first-match or origin-based tie-break. |

## Partial-success exit behavior

`--project` mode's process exit code is independent of the legacy
single-file/directory mode's exit code, but follows the same shape:

- **`0`** -- the run completed and **no** artifact has
  `ArtifactStatus.FAILED` (artifacts that are `partial`/`preserved` do not
  by themselves make the run fail -- they still produced a usable record).
- **`1`** -- at least one artifact has `ArtifactStatus.FAILED`.
- **`2`** -- CLI usage error: neither `PATH` nor `--project` was given, or
  both were given in the same invocation (`cli.py`'s
  exactly-one-of-PATH-or-`--project` enforcement). This is a pure
  argument-parsing failure, raised before any discovery/indexing happens,
  and is unrelated to artifact status.

## Deterministic ordering

Repeated runs of `--project` over the same input tree, with the same
limits and the same `--library-root` values, produce a **byte-identical**
`project-manifest.json`. Discovery, adaptation, origin override, and
resolution are all single-threaded, synchronous, comprehension-based
transformations over already-produced tuples -- no threads, no
multiprocessing, no unordered `dict`/`set` iteration ever reaches an
output field. Where order could otherwise depend on incidental filesystem
enumeration order (diagnostics, resolved reference edges), the index
explicitly sorts by a stable key (location, then code/identity, then
message) before returning. `tests/test_project_corpus_integrity.py`'s
golden-manifest test is the regression guard for this property: it asserts
the committed V21 fixture corpus reproduces the committed golden manifest
byte-for-byte.

## Source-location meaning

A `SourceLocation` is always **file + optional element**, never a line or
column number:

- `relative_path` -- the root-relative POSIX path of the artifact's file
  (see above).
- `element_id` -- an optional stable identifier for a specific element
  inside that file (e.g. an network/UID-scoped identifier), or `None` when
  the location refers to the whole file. Project mode never reports a line
  number, because SimaticML's XML representation of a `FlgNet` network or
  UDT member has no meaningful "line" in the way a text-based language
  would -- an element identifier is the only stable, structure-native
  handle available.

## Analysis-only, non-re-importable output contract

`emit_project_manifest()`'s output always includes an explicit
`output_contract` field:

```json
"output_contract": {
  "fidelity": "analysis-only",
  "reimportable": false
}
```

This is not a placeholder: **the manifest cannot regenerate a TIA
project.** It carries identity, status, location, diagnostics, and
resolved reference edges -- never a content hash, never enough structural
detail to reconstruct the original SimaticML XML, and never a write path
back into a TIA Portal project. Any downstream consumer must treat
`project-manifest.json` purely as a read-only analysis artifact.

## GRAPH deferral

Project mode never folds or renders a block's networks at all -- it never
calls `fold.fold_block()` or `emit.emit_scl()`/`emit.emit_sidecar()` (see
`cli.py`'s `_main_project()`). It only performs structural
identification: parsing enough of an artifact's XML to derive its
identity, status, location, diagnostics, and outgoing references. GRAPH
(SFC) networks -- like STL networks -- are therefore out of scope for
project mode in this release in exactly the same sense the main README
already documents for legacy single-block mode: parsed losslessly where a
block is otherwise recognized as V21 and translatable, but never folded or
rendered. GRAPH/SFC support is not implemented for either mode.

## No re-importability claim

To restate unambiguously: nothing produced by `--project` mode -- the
`project-manifest.json` file, any diagnostic, any resolved reference edge
-- can be fed back into TIA Portal, Openness, or any other tool to
regenerate or modify the original SimaticML project. Project mode is a
one-way, read-only analysis pipeline over an already-exported project
tree.
