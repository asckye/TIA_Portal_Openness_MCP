"""Analysis-only, atomic JSON manifest emitter for ``ProjectIndex``.

This module is the last stage of project-scale ingestion (Tasks 1-4 built
``project_model.py``'s immutable contracts, ``project_discovery.py``'s bounded
walk, ``project_xml.py``'s per-file V21 adapter, and ``project_index.py``'s
in-memory resolver). Given a fully-resolved ``ProjectIndex``, it serializes a
JSON-native manifest and writes it atomically.

Scope boundary: ``ArtifactRecord`` has no content-hash or byte-size field --
Tasks 1-4 never added one, and this task does not add one either. The only
SHA-256 anywhere in this codebase lives inside a diagnostic *message string*
for one UDT-parse-failure case in ``project_xml.py``, not as a structured
field. Recomputing a hash here would require reopening an artifact's file by
its stored relative path, which is exactly the TOCTOU reopen this plan's
earlier security review closed off (every artifact's bytes are read exactly
once, during discovery/adaptation -- see ``project_xml.py``'s module
docstring). So this manifest carries identity, status, location
(relative path + element_id), diagnostics, and reference edges -- nothing
else.

The manifest is analysis-only and never re-importable: ``output_contract``
declares this explicitly so downstream consumers cannot mistake the output
for a re-importable SimaticML project artifact.

Determinism: ``ProjectIndex.artifacts``/``edges``/``diagnostics`` are already
deterministically ordered by ``project_index.py``'s resolver. This module
preserves that order -- no re-sorting, no unordered ``dict``/``set`` in the
construction path -- so ``json.dumps(..., sort_keys=True)`` over the emitted
manifest is byte-identical for identical ``ProjectIndex`` values.
